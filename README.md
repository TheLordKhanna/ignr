#image guided navigation in surgical robots
Raghav Khanna's IGNR Github

This git repo consists of slicer code to perform needle insertion planning and ROS2 files used to implement a robot trajectory matching the transform from slicer. In each folder, there is a readme that describes implementation and some common errors. 

For this project, you will need to download 3DSlicer and ROS2. ROS2 is challenging - although it is possible to run on windows/mac, a linux OS is still recommended. The author has used an oracle VM to setup and run ROS2. You will also need some data to input into Slicer - segmented CT scans are recommended.
